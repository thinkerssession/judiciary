I think the seeming ignorance of the law/constitution by the Law Enforcing arms of Government is also due to the fact that the "people" are ignorant of the law.
When people are made aware of what the Consitution which is the ultimate authority, then they will be able to hold other arms of government responsible to the people. The police and all are a part of the people, government is also made of the people.
They know what is true, while some of our recruitment processes may be shallow but we can't say they do not really know the law. They know enough of the law to keep their jobs and enough of about the ignorance of the citizens about the law to oppress and flout the law.
So it still boils down really to the people being educated about the law - it will still be the people that will access the app to know about the law. The enforcers already have access to the documents per say


And why is this going to be effective
